<p>"Serendib Guide" is an Android App which will guide and instruct toursist who come to Sri Lanka. The app will suggest and direct users to iconic locations based on the crowd, weather etc. It will act as your personal guide providing you with services since touchdown. You will be able to call a cab, take a train or find a tuk tuk easily using the app at the air port.
